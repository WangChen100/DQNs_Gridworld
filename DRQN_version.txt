version-0.1: simplify experience storage, but code is wrong with the shape of feeding data
version-0.2: (1) divide return of function Experience().sample() into 5 pieces
             (2) the input batch must be arranged in trace first, batch second, as following:
    		 # [[batch1_trace1],
     		 #  [batch1_trace2],
	         #  [batch1_trace3],
        	 #  [batch2_trace1],
        	 #  [batch2_trace2],
        	 #  [batch2_trace3],]
             (3) In DRQN, lstm_output, but not lstm_state, should be used for prediction and loss
